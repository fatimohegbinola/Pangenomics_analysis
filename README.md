# Pangenomics BRIG Analysis

This repository contains code and resources for my ongoing comparative genomics research, focusing on pangenomic analysis of *Campylobacter jejuni*. The current work represents Project Class Six, with more project classes to be uploaded progressively. This analysis utilizes the BLAST Ring Image Generator (BRIG) to visualize the presence and absence of genomic regions across multiple bacterial genomes.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to explore genomic diversity among *Campylobacter jejuni* and related microbial species using pangenomic approaches, with particular emphasis on genetic variation and evolutionary patterns. The analysis pipeline involves:

- Genome collection and curation
- Sequence alignment using BLAST
- Visualization of genomic regions through BRIG
- Analysis using Geneious software

## Technologies Used

- BRIG (BLAST Ring Image Generator)
- BLAST
- Java
- Geneious
